      <p>Baker's Yeast Metabolism in 3D!</p>
      <p>
        Believe it or not, yeast shares about half of its genes with humans
        (~3,000 out of 6,000). These genes are essential for core cellular
        processes that sustain life, making yeast an invaluable model for
        studying human biology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeast metabolism reveals how cells endure stress through backup
        systemsâ€”much like our own. These systems activate to safeguard vital
        processes during failure, ensuring survival. Understanding them drives
        advancements in disease treatment and the development of new therapies.
