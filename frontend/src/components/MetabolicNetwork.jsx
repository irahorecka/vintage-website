      <p>Baker's Yeast Metabolism in 3D!</p>
      <p>
        Believe it or not, yeast shares about half of its genes with humans
        (~3,000 out of 6,000). These genes are essential for core cellular
        processes that sustain life, making yeast an invaluable model for
        studying human biology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeast metabolism reveals how cells survive stress using backup
        systemsâ€”much like ours. These mechanisms safeguard vital processes
        during failure, ensuring survival. Studying them bridges fundamental
        biology with advances in disease treatment.
