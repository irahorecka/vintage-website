A Letter of Reflection from an Ex-Friend
========================================

Hey Ira,

Hope that you've been well. This letter feels like it's been a long time coming. I'm writing... to process things. And I want to communicate better than I did in the past. I want to share as much as I can about my side. I know that you tried to explain yours in the moment. I do wonder about what you didn't say. If you feel that there's anything that you didn't say...

Starting with the present before moving backwards.

I still feel waves of hurt. Less frequently lately sure. But honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they lingered. And I think that that's okay! Our friendship was really important to me.

Today - today being the day that I'm writing this part of the letter (it's been a journey). I'm thinking about how little hurts can build up into longer, scarier hurts. Today, I'm feeling a longer, scarier hurt in a different relationship. I'm wondering about how smaller hurts might have built up for YOU in our friendship. I'm thinking about how smaller hurts built up for ME in our friendship. I want to talk about some of those smaller hurts.

I think that you can be quite funny. I also think that sometimes if feels like in groups you try to be funny because it's your way of feeling comfortable, and that means that sometimes your jokes are inappropriate. That made me uncomfortable. I don't think that it's okay to make jokes about people's weight. I don't think that it's okay to make jokes about people's sexual preferences. And I don't think that it's okay to make jokes about people's pronouns. These are hard lines for me.

I think that you were hard on my relationships. I felt like you would ask me a question meant to draw out the worst parts of my relationships, and then you would vilify me the moment I would open up about them. Why DID YOU do that? It made me not want to tell you anything about them as time went on. And then you suddenly started accusing me of idealizing my relationships. Why did YOU DO that?

I think that you could treat the women that you date more kindly. There is an overwhelming power dynamic between men and women, and I think men need to be carrying more weight to balance this dynamic. I have been working the balance between this dynamic my whole life, and I'm FUCKING EXHAUSTED. An example of what this means... This means, for example, that sometimes it's more okay for a woman to be unkind to a man than for a man to be unkind to a woman. By "okay" I don't mean acceptable, but maybe, more excusable.

Okay. So in my mind, we met in the midst of flux - in my life at least - on so many levels. There was something about our friendship that made me feel like, yes, this is it, I can do this. An arbiter of change... Does that sound stupid? I was so excited when we met. I told everyone about you. I met someone full of heart, someone that I feel really good around. The latter statement became less true over time. The former, I feel, still stands.

What do I mean by "I can do this"? I mean that through our friendship I saw the version of myself that I wanted to be. I felt myself wanting to be open with people. I felt myself wanting to speak up, to voice myself back into being. I was so closed off coming out of school...

... because there was so much that we ended up just being so misaligned on... I wonder now if being "for me" and for my values ended up making you feel like I was "against you" over, and over, and over again. And then all at once "against you" in a big way.

I want you to know though, that I WAS and still AM "for you" 110%.
